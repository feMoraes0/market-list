<h1 align="center">Market List</h1>

A simple application built with Flutter, but using some important topics as state management with [Mobx](https://mobx.netlify.com/) and local data persistence with [SQLite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite). Feel free to clone this project, learn with it or fix their problems and send me back as a pull request.
